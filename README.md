To-Do List Manager
A simple, console-based Python application for managing tasks. This project allows you to create, manage, and track your daily tasks with ease. It uses a JSON file for persistent storage so your tasks are saved between sessions.

Features
Add Tasks: Create new tasks and optionally assign a due date.
Remove Tasks: Delete tasks from the list when no longer needed.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Update the status of a task to "Completed."
View Tasks: List all tasks with their details, including:
Task Name
Status (Pending/Completed)
Due Date (if assigned)
Timestamp of when the task was added
Persistent Storage: All tasks are saved in a tasks.json file, ensuring data is not lost when the application is closed.
